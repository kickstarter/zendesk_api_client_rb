### View Counts and Caching

The view count APIs allow an API consumer to estimate how many tickets remain in a View without having to retrieve the entire View.
These APIs are intended to help estimate View size; from a business perspective, accuracy becomes less relevant as your View size increases.
To ensure quality of service, these counts are cached more heavily as the number of tickets in a View grows.  For a View with thousands of tickets,
you can expect its count to be cached for 60-90 minutes and may not reflect the actual number of tickets in your View.

### View Counts
`GET /api/v2/views/count_many.json?ids={view_id},{view_id}`

Calculates the size of the view in terms of number of tickets the view will return.
Only returns values for personal and shared views accessible to the user performing
the request.

#### Allowed For:

 * Agents

#### Using curl

```bash
curl https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/api/v2/views/count_many.json?ids={view_id} \
  -v -u {email_address}:{password}
```

#### Example Response

When you retrieve view counts that are not "fresh", it's recommended to wait for a short
while an poll again for only the stale view counts.

```http
Status: 200 OK

{
  "view_counts": [{
    "view_id": 25,
    "url":     "https://company.zendesk.com/api/v2/rules/views/25/count.json",
    "value":   719,
    "pretty":  "~700",
    "fresh":   true
  },
  {
    "view_id": 78,
    "url":     "https://company.zendesk.com/api/v2/rules/views/78/count.json",
    "value":   null,
    "pretty":  "...",
    "fresh":   false
  }
]}
```
