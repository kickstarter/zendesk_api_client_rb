## Ticket Audits

Audits are a **read-only** history of all updates to a ticket and the events that occur as a result of these updates.  When a Ticket is updated in Zendesk, we store an Audit.  Each Audit represents a single update to the Ticket, and each Audit includes a list of changes, such as:

* Changes to ticket fields
* Addition of a new comment
* Addition or removal of tags
* Notifications sent to Groups, Assignees, Requesters and CCs

To learn more about adding new comments to tickets, [see our Ticket documentation](tickets.html#updating-tickets).

### JSON Format

### The Via Object

The via object of a ticket audit or audit event tells you how or why the audit or event was created.
Via Objects can have the following keys:

| Name       | Type    | Comment
| ---------- | ------- | -------
| channel    | string  | This tells you how the ticket or event was created
| source     | object  | For some channels a source object gives more information about how or why the ticket or event was created

All via objects have a channel, but not all have a source. These are the different possible values for the channel and source values:

| channel      | source                              | Description

| system       | linked_problem, merge, follow_up    | The ticket, audit, or event was created by the system

### Audit Events

An Audit contains many Events.  These Events represent all activity which occurs on a Ticket, including public and private Comments, field changes, notifications send by business rule execution, and events which send notification to external services via our Targets framework.

If an Event has a different Via than its Audit, it will have its own Via object.

#### Ticket Comments
Comments represent the conversation between Requesters, Collaborators and Agents on a ticket. Comments can be public or private.

Ticket comments have the following keys:

| html_body       | string  | yes       | The actual comment made by the author formatted to HTML
| public          | boolean | yes       | If this is a public comment or an internal agents only note
| trusted         | boolean | yes       | If this comment is trusted or marked as being potentially fraudulent
